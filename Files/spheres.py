    The mage can determine if something has a particularly lucky characteristic
    and see if something is on the verge of breaking. Though
    these senses are far from perfect, they do make the mage a mean
    gambler and a give him insight into a little bit of luck.
    Combined with various Pattern Spheres, the mage can look
    for weaknesses in a Pattern or see where it will fracture naturally.
    The mage can also determine if a particular object or creature is
    lucky. Correspondence with Entropy lets the mage find a place
    where an unusual event may happen, and Time could let the mage

    the direction in which the Tapestry unfolds. The Disciple can
    grab the gross threads of probability where they collect and alter
    them to suit his whims. Though fine manipulation is still out of
    reach, the mage can exert a level of control that allows him to
    determine the outcome of simple events.

    By spotting random occurrences, the mage can distinguish
    predetermined or set patterns from totally chaotic ones. In any
    pattern where chance and chaos plays a part, the mage can
    make minor alterations, forcing the randomness to play out as
    he wishes. Thus, the mage can pull out a good poker hand from
    a shuffled deck of cards, influence a dice roll subtly or pull out
    the one odd sock in the sock drawer. The more complex or the
    more patterned the event, the harder it is to affect, so the mage
    is best off dealing with fairly simple and subtle changes. The
    mage doesn’t lay a hand on the Patterns around him directly.
    Instead, he influences the chance of specific things happening.
    In conjunction with Pattern Spheres, the mage can sometimes
    determine how multiple objects, creatures or forces will
    interact with one another, and which ones will meet. With
    ephemeral Spheres, the mage can sense patterns in seemingly
    random fluctuations of the Gauntlet, notice who’s likely to come

    Of course, the natural course of things always wins out in the
    end. It’s impossible to dodge Fate and erase chance completely.

    random events, forcing them to delay, making them happen
    much sooner than they would and causing a Pattern to undergo
    its natural end sooner or later than usual.

    At this level of skill, the mage can affect only set, predictable
    Patterns such as Matter and Forces. Life Patterns, with
    their constant ebb and flow, are too difficult for the mage to
    hamper directly.

    Since the mage can alter set Patterns, he can cause machines
    and systems to break down or prevent such damage. He can cause
    a device to fail, to suffer a quirky malfunction or to continue
    working long after it should’ve given out. Such blessings and
    curses do eventually wear off (and the entropy often “catches
    up” in the end), but they can be a boon in the interim.
    With Pattern Spheres, the mage can not only affect a Pattern
    with Entropy directly, but he can control how it will react with other

    massively complex developments and make a good guess at influencing

    things grow, mature, change, adapt and die, how they decay,
    how they feed into the cycle of life and death. By changing the
