        9 Breaking a word of honor to a clanmate
        Solidarity is important to the assamites' holy cause.

        8 Refusing to offer a non-Assamite an opportunity to convert
        The childer of Khayyin are accursed and must be saved.

        7 Failing to destroy an unrepentant Kindred outside the Clan
        Those who do not accept Haqim’s teachings forfeit their unlives.

        6 Succumbing to frenzy
        Haqim teaches ascendance, not indulgence.

        5 Failing to pursue the lore of Khayyin
        To oppose one’s enemies successfully, one must learn all about them.

        4 Failing to demand blood as payment
        Other members of the Clan may benefit from such vitae, no matter how diluted.

        3 Refusal to aid a more advanced member of the Path
        To act selfishly is to fall into the snares of Khayyin’s pawn.

        2 Failing to tithe blood
        Haqim has decreed this as paramount to his childer’s cause.

        Denial of the self serves no greater purpose.

        6 Succumbing to frenzy
        The Beast is irrational, and emotion serves little to advance understanding.

        Experimentation proves theory, and without proof, there is no conclusion.

        Vampires are dead; so, too, are their emotions.

        Death is inevitable; what meaning does easing benefit another’s doomed discomfort have?

        One must not prevent the cycle, but should learn from it.

        Caine was separated from mortals, as all vampires should be.
