    places where he might show up. There is no
    mechanical effect at this stage, but it should be roleplayed.
    All childer have this level of bond toward their
    sires, for the Embrace itself forces one drink upon the
    childer; they may love their “parents,” hate them, or
    both, but are rarely indifferent toward them.

    • Second drink: The drinker’s feelings grow strong
    enough to influence her behavior. Though she is by
    no means enslaved to the vampire, he is definitely an
    important figure in her life. She may act as she pleases,
    but might have to make a Willpower roll to take actions
    directly harmful to the vampire. The vampire’s
    influence is such that he can persuade or command her
    with little effort (Social rolls against the thrall are at
    -1 difficulty)."""     
        part2 = """• Third drink: Full-scale blood bond. At this level,
    the drinker is more or less completely bound to the
    vampire. He is the most important person in her life;
    lovers, relatives, and even children become secondary
    to her all-consuming passion.

    At this level, a regnant may use the Dominate Discipline
    on a thrall, even without the benefit of eye contact.
    Merely hearing the regnant’s voice is enough. Additionally,
    should the thrall try to resist the Dominate
    (or similar mental control power) for some reason, the
    difficulty of such resistance is increased by two. Naturally,
    a higher-Generation vampire still cannot use
    Dominate on a lower-Generation thrall.

    The blood bond is true love, albeit a twisted and perverse
    version of it. Ultimately, we can’t reduce the vagaries
    of love down to a simple “yes/no” system. Some
    thralls (particularly people with Conformist or other
    dependent Natures, or with Willpower 5 or less) will
    commit any act, including suicide or murder, for their
    beloved; other characters have certain core principles
    that they will not violate."""
        part3= """A full blood bond, once formed, is nearly inviolate.
    Once bound, a thrall is under the sway of her regnant
    and her regnant only. She cannot be bound again by
    another vampire unless the first blood bond wears away
    “naturally.” A vampire can experience lesser (one- and
    two-drink) bonds toward several individuals; indeed,
    many Kindred enjoy such bonds, as they create artificial
    passion in their dead hearts. Upon the formation
    of a full blood bond, though, all lesser sensations are
    wiped away. Vampire lovers occasionally enter into
    mutual blood bonds with each other; this is the closest
    thing the undead can feel to true love. Even this sensation
    can turn to disgust or hate over the centuries,
    though, and in any event few Kindred trust each other
    enough to initiate it.

    A blood bond is a mighty force, but it is at its most
    potent when perpetually reinforced with further drinks.
    Feeding a thrall often reinforces the bond, while depriving
    a thrall of vitae may cause the bond to grow
    tepid over time. Like any other relationship, treatment
    and courtesy play a part in the dynamics of the bond.
    A thrall who is treated well and fed often will likely
    fall even more deeply in love, while a thrall who is degraded
    and humiliated may find resentment and anger
    eating away at the bond."""
        part4 = """It is possible, though difficult, for a vampire to temporarily
        resist a blood bond. Doing so requires the
        player to make a Willpower roll (difficulty is typically
        8, though this can be modified depending on the regnant’s
        treatment and the thrall’s Nature) and accumulate
        a number of successes equal to the number of
        times the thrall has partaken of the regnant’s blood, to
        a maximum of difficulty 9. The thrall must then spend
        a Willpower point. Upon doing so, the bond is negated
        for a variable amount of time: from one scene (if the
        thrall merely wishes to plot against the regnant, deliver
        confidential information to an enemy, etc.) to one turn
        (if the thrall wishes to attack the regnant physically).
        The thrall can continue to expend Willpower to extend
        the duration of “freedom,” but once she ceases doing
        so, the blood bond resumes at full force.

        A blood bond can be broken, though this requires
        the thrall to not only avoid the regnant entirely for an
        extended period of time, but also spend great amounts
        of Willpower to overcome the addiction. As a general
        rule, a thrall who neither sees nor feeds from her
        regnant for a period of (12 - Willpower) months finds
        her bond reduced by one level (so, a fully bound thrall
        with a Willpower of 5 has her blood bond reduced to
        the equivalent of two drinks if she goes seven straight
        months without any contact with the regnant). If the
        bond is reduced to zero in this fashion (a feat typically
        accompanied by the expenditure of a great deal of
        Willpower on the thrall’s part, as she resists the gnawing
        urge to seek out her sire), it is nullified entirely."""

    of the bond is to kill the regnant. Such a choice is extremely

    that everything will go smoothly. Those who have
    been released by such means claim the bond shatters like
    spun glass upon the moment of the regnant’s Final Death.
    The thrall’s Nature may play a large part in whether the
    control is completely ended, though, and such aftermath
    is best left in the hands of the Storyteller."""

    victim’s body and taken into the diablerist’s. The effort

    victim cannot soak, and damage is considered aggravated).
    When all the victim’s health levels have been
    drained, the victim’s essence is taken into the attacker
    and the emptied body begins decaying immediately.

    A vampire committing diablerie is quite vulnerable

    draw forth the essence of the victim, and stopping for
    even a moment ruins the chance of capturing the spirit.

    is overwhelmed by euphoria, and a Self-Control/Instincts
    roll is necessary (difficulty 10 minus the character’s
    Humanity or Path rating) to avoid losing control.
    The sensation is akin to orgasm, but much more powerful
    — so powerful, in fact, that certain Kindred are
    addicted to the sensation. All other Kindred fear these
    vampires for their addiction to the pleasures of Amaranth
    makes them a threat to everyone. Even vampires
    too weak to provide additional power are devoured for
    the simple pleasure of the act.

    The true benefit of diablerie becomes evident if the
    diablerist feeds on the vitae of a vampire of lower Generation
    (e.g., if a Ninth-Generation vampire commits
    diablerie on a Seventh-Generation vampire). The diablerist
    literally steals the power and potency of the victim’s
    own blood, and thus permanently lowers her own
    Generation by one, bringing her closer to the mythical
    power of Caine. All benefits of the lowered Generation
    — a larger and more potent blood pool, the ability to
    Dominate more Kindred and, in some cases, the ability
    to increase Traits above 5 — are bestowed upon the
    vampire.

    If the victim was of far greater power (five or more
    Generation levels) than the diablerist, the Storyteller
    may rule that the predator lowers her Generation by
    more than one step. This is particularly likely if the
    victim was ancient (two millennia or more). It would
    not be unreasonable for a Twelfth-Generation neonate
    who drank the blood of a 3000-year-old member
    of the Fifth Generation to advance three or even more
    Generation steps. Ultimately, this decision rests in the
    Storyteller’s hands."""
        part4= """Moreover, drinking the vitae of elder vampires can induce
    a temporary increase in the diablerist’s Discipline
    levels (by one, two, or even more dots), as the potent
    blood augments the predator’s own mystic arts. If the elder
    vampire was several Generations removed from the diablerist’s
    own Generation, the effects can seem miraculous,
    even if they are short lived. These increased powers last for
    a single scene, unless the Storyteller decides otherwise.
    To commit diablerie, the diablerist must take blood
    directly and immediately from the victim; the blood
    may not be stored and used later. Moreover, only one
    diablerist may commit the act on a given victim; a pack
    of neonates cannot swarm around an elder like hungry
    sharks, no matter how potent the victim’s blood."""
        part5= """Committing diablerie seems like the perfect crime
    to many power-hungry neonates. There is no body left
    when the deed is done, as most vampires over a decade
    old quickly rot into unrecognizable mounds of carrion.
    Without solid evidence, it’s difficult for even the most
    despotic Prince to make an outright accusation of murder.
    But those who commit the atrocity soon learn that
    diablerists wear the evidence of their crime on their very
    souls. Vampires with the Auspex Discipline can detect a
    diablerist by using Aura Perception. The stolen energies
    of the victim mingle with the energies of the diablerist,
    leaving thick black marks running through the diablerist’s
    aura. These marks stand out as clearly as motor oil
    on a crystal-clear pond, covering the softer colors of the
    vampire’s own aura and betraying the crime.

    Not all vampires know of diablerie or the stains it
    leaves behind. Many younger Kindred might simply
    question the odd discoloration on the vampire’s aura.
    Most elder vampires understand what the stains mean,
    though, and could well call for the diablerist’s immediate
    punishment or use the information as blackmail
    at a later date. These marks remain in evidence for a
    number of years equal to the difference between the
    victim’s Generation and the diablerist’s original Generation
    (mimimum one year, even if the victim was
    higher Generation). In example, if a Twelfth-Generation
    vampire drinks the blood of a Ninth-Generation
    vampire (becoming Eleventh Generation in the process),
    the evidence remains on his aura for three years."""

    the Path of Blood to detect the diablerist’s sin, even

    the Tremere.

    Even those without special perceptions often sense
    a “taint” about the diablerist. For one month per Generation
    removed from the victim, a diablerist gives off
    a “vibe” that leaves more sensitive Kindred unsettled.
    The Kindred in question may not actually know what
    the diablerist did, but they’ll feel uncomfortable around
    him just the same. A player whose vampire comes in
    contact with a diablerist may make a Perception roll
    (difficulty of 12 minus the sensing vampire’s Humanity
    rating — vampires with high Humanity are more
    aware of such things) to notice that something about
    the diablerist just “doesn’t feel right.” Followers of alternate
    Paths of morality (see Chapter Ten) generally
    fail to notice the unusual sensation, as they are no longer
    attuned to their emotions in the same way. The
    Storyteller has final say in these matters.

    A few rumors speak of diablerists displaying certain
    mannerisms of their late victims, particularly if the victims
    were of great psychic fortitude (Willpower 10) and
    of much stronger Blood than their murderers. If this is
    true, and the soul of a particularly mighty undead can
    manifest in the body of its killer, the implications are
    frightening, particularly in light of the Jyhad."""
        part7= """ Such is the horror of diablerie that, according to
    most elders, even a blood hunt is no grounds for its
    practice. Hunters may drink a victim’s blood, even to
    the last drop, but may not continue the process of diablerie
    once the victim is drained. Indeed, by decree of
    the Inner Circle, only a sire is permitted to diablerize
    her childe, and then only during a blood hunt. In practice,
    many younger Kindred take every opportunity a
    blood hunt’s chaos affords, and Princes may look the
    other way if the criminal was heinous enough.

    Lastly, for Camarilla vampires and others who adhere
    to the way of Humanity, there is the loss of Humanity
    to consider. Diablerie is worse than murder: The Amaranth
    literally absorbs the victim’s soul, destroying any
    chance of the victim finding peace in the afterlife. Such
    a heinous crime strips a minimum of one Humanity dot
    from the character’s Humanity rating. Additionally, for
    extremely vicious attacks, the Storyteller might require
    a Conscience roll (difficulty 8). Failure means the loss
    of an additional Humanity point, while a botch could
